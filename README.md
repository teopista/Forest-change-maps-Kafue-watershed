This script is meant to produce forest change maps using the forest change map output from the 'forest change mask' module in sepal. 
https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/modules/dwn/gfc_wrapper_python.html  
The output from that module is a combination of the GFC dataset including treecover2000, loss from 2001-2020 and gain 2012
