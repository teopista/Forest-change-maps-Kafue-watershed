Forest change maps-Kafue watershed script is meant to produce forest change maps of different time periods for the Kafue watershed. Forest change maps for the periods between 2000-2020 are produced.

The input forest change map used in this script was produced using the 'forest change mask' module in sepal. The map is a combination of the Global Forest Change datasets including treecover2000, annual loss from 2001-2020 and gain 2001-2012 with a total of 24 classes. For more information on the module, visit https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/modules/dwn/gfc_wrapper_python.html 

A tree cover canopy of greater than 10% was considered while using the forest change mask module in sepal. This is because of the Zambiaâ€™s forest definition where forest land is any land with a tree canopy cover of more than ten percent and area of more than zero point five hectares and a tree height of five meters.
