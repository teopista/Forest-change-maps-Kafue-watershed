This script is meant to reclass the forest change map into different periods. 
The input forest change map was produced using the 'forest change mask' module in sepal. https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/modules/dwn/gfc_wrapper_python.html 
The map is a combination of the GFC datasets including treecover2000, loss from 2001-2020 and gain 2012

A tree cover canopy of greater than 10% was considered while using the forest change mask module in sepal

## Tree cover loss 2000-2020
